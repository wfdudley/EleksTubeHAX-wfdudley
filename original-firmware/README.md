# Restore the original firmware
This directory is useful for if you just want to restore the original firmware, 
or if you hack your clock into a state you don't know how to recover from.

The file `fw-backup-4M.bin` is a full dump of the entire 4MB flash as I 
(`SmittyHalibut`) received it.  It's similar to the output of `dd if=/dev/sda of=file.img`
in that it includes the ENTIRE flash: boot loader, partition table, all the partitions, etc.

## Firmware Images Unique To Each Clock?
See https://github.com/SmittyHalibut/EleksTubeHAX/issues/8

Looks like the MAC address of the device is in the Firmware and needs updating.  Copied
from that github issue:

Hi Jens @koshisan, I have found how to convert @SmittyHalibut original firmware in this repo to work on my clock!

The discovery is that the MAC address in the firmware must match the factory programmed MAC address in your clock.

Here are the steps (in Windows):

    Find the MAC address in your clock:
    esptool flash_id
    Look for the line that starts MAC:

    Replace all 42 instances of the MAC address in your copy of fw-backup-4M.bin.
    Note that the 6 MAC bytes in the firmware are in reverse byte order from the MAC: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx format in step 1.
    I used WinMerge https://winmerge.org/ to edit the firmware binary with the following steps:

2a. Make a copy of fw-backup-4M.bin (I named it edited_fw-backup-4M.bin)
2b. Open both bin files side-by-side in WinMerge (they should be identical)
2c. Select the edited_fw-backup-4M.bin pane in WinMerge
2d. Edit->Replace <bh:80><bh:93><bh:2f><bh:84><bh:db><bh:e8> with <bh:xx><bh:xx><bh:xx><bh:xx><bh:xx><bh:xx>
     Click Replace all following occurrences (it may report 43 differences - there are actually 42)
     where the xx bytes are replaced with your clock MAC address bytes (reverse order from Step1. format). 
     The last 2-3 bytes should be the same.
2e. Save the edited_fw-backup-4M.bin file

    Restore the edited_fw-backup-4M.bin firmware to your clock:
    esptool --baud 115200 --port [COM port] write_flash 0x0 edited_fw-backup-4M.bin

Hopefully this also works on your clock.
Please reply with you results. 頑張って

## Writing Firmware To Your Clock
You can resture this image using `esptool.py`, which you have to get yourself.  I provide
a script `restore-firmware.sh` which uses `esptool.py` from my install of Arduino 1.8, 
but you can update it to point to where ever you have `esptool.py` installed.  (Similarly,
update for Python if needed.)

`fw-strings.txt` is the output of `strings fw-backup-4M.bin`. It might contain some useful
information about what was in the original firmware, such as what libraries were used, etc.

Additional by wfdudley:

The stock image files are 64800 bytes long, which is
exactly 135 (rows) * 240 (columns) * (2 bytes/integer)

You can split the image files using the unix "split" utility:

split -b 64800 -d -t '\0' big-font-blob

generates 10 or 11 files (some fonts have an 11th "blank" character)

You can look at the extracted images with this tool:

Look at raw image files with https://rawpixels.net/
just specify RGB565 format and proper width and height.

The .CLK files can also be viewed using this tool, by specifying
an offset of 6 bytes from the beginning.  This skips over the
"magic number" "CK" at the beginning, followed by the width and height
as 16 bit integers.

You can also use the scripts in the utilities to change image file
formats between .raw, .clk, .png, and .bmp.  For the last two,
the ffmpeg utility does the work.  Unfortunately, ffmpeg has
a buggy conversion from .png to .raw, so use .bmp for your
archival storage and conversion.

Finally, you can use these unix tools on your Winders system by installing
the Cygwin environment (www.cygwin.com).
